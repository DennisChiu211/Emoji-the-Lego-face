# Emoji-the-Lego-face
Using Variational Autoencodersâ€‹ to morph between lego face and emoji images, and creating an AI-based tool that allows users to effortlessly apply Emoji expressions to the input Lego faces.

# Motivation
Facial expressions are an important characteristic for showcasing a character's uniqueness, as each character conveys different emotions in various expressions. Therefore, we want to develop an AI-based tool to alter the facial expressions of character images.

While there are many image generators that can modify facial expressions, the process of using prompts to generate new images can sometimes be very tedious, and providing the right prompts for these AI-based generative tools can be very time-consuming. Moreover, by only using prompts for image generation we can not directly forsee how the output results will be.

Hence, Our concept is to free users from the confines of text. We create an interface which is really simple to use by changing input characters' expression through choosing different expression,  provide a more intuitive and straightforward way to create new images without the need for cumbersome text descriptions.
